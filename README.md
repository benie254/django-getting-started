# Getting Started with Django on Linux

A guide for getting started with Django by creating a Django project, a Django app, making the initial migration, and running the Django development server.

## 1. Getting Started

### A. Resources

For a more comprehensive guide to working with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), check out the official [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/).

### B. Requirements

For the purposes of this guide, you will need:

- A [Linux](https://www.linux.org/pages/download/) operating system.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3 or higher installed in your system.
- A [code editor](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/popular-ides-and-code-editors/) e.g. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## 2. Initializing Django

Before you can install Django and create a Django project or app, you will need to set up a **virtual environment**.

### A. Virtual Environment

Think of a **virtual environment** as a container to store all the packages/libraries that you will use in your Django project.

- This sets aside your project's packages from those already installed globally in your system.
- It also helps you avoid overloading your project with the other installed packages, which you may not need/want to use in the project.

Learn more about a **Python virtual environment** in the official [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
